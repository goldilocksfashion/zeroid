# Zero Id

## Overview
Zero Id is a privacy-preserving decentralized identity system built on zero-knowledge proofs and DID:peer technology. It provides a cloudless, peer-to-peer identity framework that enables secure verification without compromising personal data.

## What We're Building
Zero Id creates a comprehensive identity solution with these key components:

- **Privacy-First Identity**: A DID:peer-based identifier (512 bytes) that enables verifiable claims without revealing sensitive information
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: On-chain storage of ZK proofs for identity verification using RISC Zero
- **Off-Chain NFT System**: Support for up to 10 NFTs per identity with on-chain ownership proofs
- **Decentralized Architecture**: Fully peer-to-peer system with no central servers or cloud dependencies

## Key Features

### Identity Management
- Generate and manage DID:peer identifiers
- Create and verify zero-knowledge proofs about identity attributes
- Direct peer-to-peer authentication without intermediaries

### NFT Capabilities
- Create and transfer NFTs tied to Zero Id
- Maintain ownership records on-chain using ZK proofs
- Preserve privacy while ensuring verifiable ownership

### Decentralized Verification
- Verify identity without revealing underlying data
- Authenticate to services while maintaining anonymity
- Authorize actions based on provable attributes

### P2P Infrastructure
- Discover peers through distributed hash tables (DHT)
- Transfer data and proofs directly between peers
- Maintain blockchain consensus in a fully decentralized manner

## Use Cases
- **Social Networks**: Build privacy-preserving social platforms
- **Marketplaces**: Enable secure peer-to-peer transactions
- **Authentication Systems**: Replace traditional login systems with ZK verification
- **Decentralized Governance**: Create reputation systems without compromising identity

## Why a Library?
Zero Id is designed as a library to provide a portable, flexible foundation for decentralized applications:

1. **Portability**: Easily integrate Zero Id into any Rust-based application
2. **Composability**: Use specific components or the entire identity stack
3. **Extensibility**: Build custom verification workflows on top of the core primitives
4. **Interoperability**: Work seamlessly with existing DID and ZK proof systems

## Technical Stack
- **Core**: Rust-based implementation
- **ZK Proofs**: RISC Zero for ZK-STARK generation and verification
- **P2P Networking**: libp2p for peer discovery and communication
- **Cryptography**: Ed25519 signatures and advanced cryptographic primitives
- **Blockchain**: Custom lightweight blockchain for proof storage and verification
