# ZeroID ðŸš€

### This is a WIP, stay tuned for final version

### A Cloudless, Decentralized DID Key Generator & Identity Verification Library

ZeroID is an **open-source, cloudless, and privacy-focused** identity system for generating **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** and verifying age or identity **without relying on Google, Microsoft, or any cloud services**. It uses **OCR, QR codes, and cryptographic DID keypairs** to provide **self-sovereign identity**.

ðŸ”¹ **Privacy-first**: No central servers, fully peer-to-peer.  
ðŸ”¹ **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Verifies age without revealing personal data.  
ðŸ”¹ **Works Offline**: No cloud, no tracking, full local ownership.  
ðŸ”¹ **Free & Open-Source**: Licensed under **MPL-2.0**, ensuring openness forever.
